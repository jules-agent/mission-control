      "description": "Implement comprehensive FedRAMP High security controls and compliance protocols for UP.FIT government/fleet deployments.\n\n## Scope:\n- FedRAMP High baseline controls implementation (421 controls)\n- Security documentation and System Security Plan (SSP)\n- Continuous monitoring and auditing capabilities\n- Encryption at rest and in transit (FIPS 140-2 validated)\n- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access\n- Access control and least privilege enforcement\n- Audit logging and retention (minimum 1 year)\n- Incident response procedures\n- Vulnerability scanning and remediation\n- Penetration testing (annual)\n\n## Progress (Feb 13, 4:00 AM):\n✅ Created comprehensive 30-page implementation plan at `projects/fedramp-compliance/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`\n✅ Documented all 18 control families (AC, AU, AT, CM, CP, IA, IR, MA, MP, PE, PL, PS, RA, CA, SC, SI, SA, PM)\n✅ Mapped 5-phase implementation timeline (12-18 months)\n✅ Budget analysis: $800K-1.5M Year 1, $225K-495K/year ongoing\n✅ Recommended phased approach: CJIS → ISO 27001 → FedRAMP Moderate → FedRAMP High\n✅ Identified staffing needs: ISSO, Security Engineers, external 3PAO assessment\n✅ Technology stack recommendations (SIEM, vuln scanning, MFA, GRC platforms)\n✅ Risk assessment and go/no-go decision criteria\n\n## Key Findings:\n- **Alternative path recommended:** Start with CJIS compliance ($150K, 6 months) for immediate law enforcement contracts (LVMPD)\n- **FedRAMP Moderate first:** Lower bar (325 vs 421 controls), faster/cheaper, then upgrade to High if needed\n- **Total phased investment:** $1.35M over 3 years vs $1.5M all at once\n- **Critical first hire:** ISSO (Information System Security Officer) - $120K-180K/year\n\n## Relevant to:\n- UP.FIT government fleet contracts\n- LVMPD and other law enforcement deployments\n- Federal procurement eligibility\n- DOD, DHS, DOJ high-value contracts\n\n## Next Steps:\n- Review implementation plan with Ben + UP.FIT leadership\n- Customer discovery: Survey LVMPD, Skydio, gov customers on compliance priorities\n- Budget approval for Phase 1: CJIS + ISO 27001 ($250K)\n- Hire ISSO (critical first step)\n- Engage FedRAMP/CJIS consultant for gap analysis\n\n## Priority Context:\nHigh priority for federal/government sales pipeline. Required for contracts with federal agencies and many state/local government entities.",

      "description": "iPhone + Android app for parents to share kids clothing sizes, preferences, and style photos.\n\n## Core Value Prop:\nRetain accurate sizing data for kids — solves \"what size is my kid now?\" for everyone who buys them clothes.\n\n## Key Features:\n1. Parents store kids sizes (clothes, shoes) — updated as they grow\n2. Notes on what kids like/dont like\n3. Upload photos of clothes and styles they like\n4. **Killer feature:** Request sizing data from non-users (grandparents, co-parents) — seamlessly enrolls them as guest profile without account\n5. Affiliate revenue from shopping recommendations based on sizes + preferences\n\n## Viral Loop:\n- School parent groups + cousin circles = organic distribution\n- Every sizing request = new user enrollment\n- Birthday/holiday seasons = growth events\n\n## Origin:\nMaggies idea — her friend network is the distribution channel. Parent groups at Auggies school are tight viral networks.\n\n## Comparable:\nBabyList, but focused on ongoing size tracking vs one-time registry.\n\n## Revenue:\nAffiliate commissions on clothing purchases (size-matched recommendations)\n\n## Status:\nMVP wireframes and tech stack in progress.",
